                <p class="p-3">Hello, my name is Daryl Cimafranca and I would like to welcome you to my portfolio page! I am a gigantic nerd who loves to play videogames, watch anime, and just chill in general.
                <br> 
                <br>
                I am a very enthusiastic person who is willing to learn new things.
                I'm highly adaptable and a very easy person to work with. I can say these things safely because I'm team player in the multiplayer games I play like
                Final Fantasy XIV: Online, PUBG, League of Legends, and Overwatch.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm also a very avid fighting game fan. I love playing Dragon Ball Fighterz, Tekken 7, Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition and Ultra Street Fighter IV.
                My favorite professional fighting game players are Daigo Umehara, Tokido, GO1, Infiltration, Filipino Champ, Justin Wong, and Momochi.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another unimportant tidbit about me is that I'm a big Vocaloid fan. (My profile picture was when I was in Japan for a Vocaloid concert.) I really admire the creative community for it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Well, that's enough about me, I hope you like what you see!
